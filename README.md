## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

-   `src`: the folder to maintain sources
-   `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# Notes on my Learnings

Operator Description Example Description
++ Increment a++ a = a + 1 (adds one from a)
-- Decrement a-- a = a – 1 (subtract one from a)
+= Add and assign a+=2 a = a + 2
-= Subtract and assign a-=2 a = a – 2
_= Multiply and assign a_=3 a = a \* 3
/= Divide and assign a/=4 a = a / 4
%= Modulus and assign a%=5 a = a mod 5
