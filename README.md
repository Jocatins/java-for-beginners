# Notes on my Learnings

Operator Description Example Description
++ Increment a++ a = a + 1 (adds one from a)
-- Decrement a-- a = a – 1 (subtract one from a)
+= Add and assign a+=2 a = a + 2
-= Subtract and assign a-=2 a = a – 2
_= Multiply and assign a_=3 a = a \* 3
/= Divide and assign a/=4 a = a / 4
%= Modulus and assign a%=5 a = a mod 5

The for Loop can be used for just one statement:
for(initialization; condition; iteration) statement;

Loops are structures used to make the program repeat one or many instructions for ‘n’ times as
specified in the declaration of the loop.

The for Loop can be used for just one statement:

or to repeat a block of code:
for(initialization; condition; iteration)
{
